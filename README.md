ScalaBlackJack
-----------------------

Web service to display the optimal move (given perfect information)
in blackjack.

Purpose: to create something that does something using scala.

Warning: this is the first thing I ever wrote in scala and still smells of java, don't copy this style

Also comes with an unfinished, nonworking client side script to play a game
and get feedback about how badly you are doing using the information
from the service. I'll finish this later, maybe.

License is do whatever you want.
